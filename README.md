# Dario Battle
---
This is a Battle mode-like of Super Mario Bros game.  
We did this as part of the AWS module taught at ISTY by Luca De Feo.  

All the images, sounds, videos are the property of &copy;Nintendo.  
We know that the code isn't clean at all, we should rework this project to do something better
with the help of the knowledge we have acquired now.   
Although we put this on GitHub to help some people to understand how a Web-Game is working.
